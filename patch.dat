This file is needed to skip a cyclic redundancy check in GridGame.exe which
allows TEM to ship its own GridGameLauncher.exe without patching any of the
original files. The contents of this file are meaningless to the game as it only
checks if the file can be opened. TEM handles the rest in order to bypass all
SecuROM spot checks.

The original launcher is unhealthy for you and your machine! Here are the
advantages with the new launcher:
* No brain-dead checks that disallow hardware changes
* No useless inter process communication
* No slow game starts

Thanks to Propaganda Games for making Tron: Evolution and for implementing this
backdoor! Bye bye SecuROM :D
